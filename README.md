# Projects
Just trying some projects from [[here]](https://github.com/karan/Projects-Solutions)

## Chatbot
Currently just a basic chatbot compromising of some conditional statements.
#### To add in the future:
 Â [x] **String similarity test:** currently, the questions we can ask are limited and does not allow any mistakes in writing except it's case, this feature will change that.
  [ ] **Improving the database** Increasing the diversity of the chat is the motto.
  [ ] **adding features** Like integrating with windows to execute certain commands/do a google search etc.
  [ ] **maybe adding a voiceover** not sure about this
  [ ] **Better User interface** 
  Will add more as I think of them
